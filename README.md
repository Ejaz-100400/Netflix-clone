## Technologies Used

The Netflix clone website was built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications
- MongoDB: A NoSQL document-oriented database
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework
- Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- React Router: A routing library for React
- Swiper Js: A JavaScript library that creates modern touch sliders with hardware-accelerated transitions 
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework. Much easier to use because it has a comprehensive grid system with many elements already built.
